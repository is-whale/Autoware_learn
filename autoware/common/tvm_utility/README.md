# TVM Utility Library

A set of c++ utilities to help build a TVM based machine learning inference
pipeline. The library contains a pipeline class which helps building the
pipeline and a number of utility functions that are common in machine learning.

## The Pipeline Class

The Pipeline Class is a standardized way to write a inference pipeline. The
pipeline class contains 3 different stages: the pre-processor, the inference
engine and the post processor. The TVM implementation of an inference engine
stage is provided. The pre and post processor need to be implemented by the user
before instantiating the pipeline. You can see example usage in this
[example_pipeline](test/yolo_v2_tiny).

Each stage in the pipeline has a `schedule` function which takes input data as a
parameter and return the output data. Once the pipeline object is created,
`pipeline.schedule` is called to run the pipeline.

```cpp
int main() {
  nh_.subscribe<sensor_msgs::PointCloud2>("/points_raw", 1, [pipeline, pub]() {
    pub.publish(pipeline.schedule(msg));
  });
}
```

## The Utility Functions

A set of utility functions common in machine learning that can be used in
building the pipeline.

## Error

`std::runtime_error` should be thrown whenever error is encountered. It should
be populated with an appropriate text error description.
