* fix to free a NULL window
* Enable building nodes on the kinetic setup
  -road_wizard
  -klt_tracker
* Add README for region_tlr_ssd
* Fix for latest specification
* Prepare for merge
  * Fix assumed SSD path in CMakeLists.txt
  * Change default path of trained model into package-internal directory
  * Remove `std::cerr` statements for debug
  * Add UI to boot `traffic_light_recognition_ssd.launch` from runtime-manager
* Update state_transition_matrix
* Fix bug of vector_map_server usage
* Re-implement filter of signal orientation
  Target traffic light should face to camera.
  In this modification, target light will be chosen if it faces to camera +- 50 degree in camera coordinate system
* Apply vector_map_server function
* Fix usage of std::string::substr
* Modify State Transition Matrix of TLR for more precise recognition
  * w.r.t `region_tlr`, just fixed comment
  * w.r.t `region_tlr_ssd`, applied manner of erring on the side of caution
* Add region_tlr_ssd
* Add roi_extractor.launch to make handling parameter easy
  And fixed small bug to get parameter from ROS private parameter server

  We need improve output data label format to apply RCNN easily.
* Add roi_extractor node
* Move context-regarding files as package header and library
* Extract context operations as class method for future shared-use
* convert to autoware_msgs

1.1.2 (2017-02-27 23:10)
------------------------

1.1.1 (2017-02-27 22:25)

------------------

1.0.1 (2017-01-14)
------------------

1.0.0 (2016-12-22)
------------------
* Fix codes to use map_file messages and old vector_map_info topics
* Publish the detection result when it is different from the previous one
* Modify region_tlr so that it publishes superimpose image as topic
  Superimpose result image is now available as topic named
  "/tlr_superimpose_image"
* Uncomment publish statement of region_tlr
  Now region_tlr node publishes "light_color" topic
  as traffic light recognition result which is
  subscribed by traffic_light_viewer
* Runtime Manager, update feat_proj for SIGINT termination
* Uncomment publish statement of region_tlr
  Now region_tlr node publishes "light_color" topic
  as traffic light recognition result which is
  subscribed by traffic_light_viewer
* Add module graph tool
* Modify to get camera ID from runtime manager
  * Make it possible to obtain camera ID in each node to subscribe topics
  under camera name space selectively
  * Get image size from sensor_msgs::Image instead of CameraInfo
* Eigen3 with Fallback on ros-catkin-modules
* Change frame ID according to used camera
* Modify launch files to specify source camera
* Add condition to ignore signals not for cars
* Add ifdef to control showing debug information
* Make camera_info source selectable
  I modified nodes that subscribe /camera/camera_info
  so that we can specify the topic name from launch file
* Make image source selectable from launch file
  In order to use multiple camera, I modified
  - all viewers
  - some cv_tracker's packages and a library
  - lane_detector package
  - some road_wizard package
  so that input image topic can be changed easily from launch file
* Remove sound player execution from traffic_light_recognition.launch
* Clean up Qt5 configuration
  Use pkg-config as possible instead of absolute pathes.
* Use c++11 option instead of c++0x
  We can use newer compilers which support 'c++11' option
* Update region_tlr
  - Add area-size condition to remove false detection caused by background
  in ROI
  - Update STATE_TRANSITION_MATRIX so that state will be UNDEFINED if
  impossible state change happens
  - minor fix
* Update threshold
  Increased threshold value with regard to update state of detected
  traffic light color
* Fix traffic_light_detection
  I modified traffic_light_detection so that fragmented signal lamps are
  assembled in a context by its poleID
* Modified region_tlr so that we can switch displaying image of superimpose result
  And this commit achieves
  - resizable image window showing superimpose result,
  - making close button on the window usable
* Modified feat_proj so that we can adjust projection error from runtime manger
* Initial commit for public release
