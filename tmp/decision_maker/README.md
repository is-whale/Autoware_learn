## Runtime Manager Parameters
Parameter|Type|Description
--|---|--
auto_mission_reload|Bool|(default: *false*)<br>If this is set true, decision maker automatically reloads mission as new mission after previous mission is completed.
auto_engage|Bool|(default: *false*)<br>If this is set true, decision maker automatically engage immediately after ready to drive.
auto_mission_change|Bool|(default: *false*)<br>If this is set true, decision maker automatically change the mission(waypoint) without state_cmd when new mission is loaded while driving.
use_fms|Bool|(default: *false*)<br>This must be true in order to incoorporate with [Autoware Management System](https://github.com/CPFL/AMS)
disuse_vector_map|Bool|(default: *false*)<br> If set *true*, decision_maker will bypass loading a vector map on startup.
num_of_steer_behind|Int|(default: *20*)<br> lookup distance along waypoints to determine steering state(straight, turning right, or turning left)
change_threshold_dist|Double|(default: *1*)<br> This is relevent only if *use_fms* is *true*.<br> If the distance from vehicle to closest waypoint in the new mission is further than *change_threshold_dist* [m], mission change fails.
change_threshold_angle|Double|(default:*15*)<br>This is relevent only if *use_fms* is *true*.<br> If the angle from vehicle to closest waypoint in the new mission is further than this *change_threshold_dist* [deg], mission change fails.
time_to_avoidance|Double|(default: *3*)<br> If the vehicle is stuck for *time_to_avoidance* seconds (e.g. due to obstacles), the state transits to from "Go" to "Avoidance".
goal_threshold_dist|Double|(default: *3*)<br> Threshold used to check if vehicle has reached to the goal (i.e. end of waypoints). The vehicle must be less than *goal_threshold_dist* [m] to the goal.
goal_threshold_vel|Double|(default: *0.1*)<br> Threshold used to check if vehicle has reached to the goal (i.e. end of waypoints). The vehicle must be less than *goal_threshold_vel* [m/s] to be treated as goal arrival.

## ROS Parameters
Parameter|Type|Description
--|---|--
state_vehicle_file_name|string|file that defines vehicle state transition
state_mission_file_name|string|file that defines mission state transition

## Basic Usage in Autoware

### Preparations

- For state visualization, please add OverlayText type displays on rviz and select topics `decision_maker/operator_help_text`, `decision_maker/state_overlay`.  
<img src="docs/state_overlay.png" width=800>


- For publish `/state_cmd` topic by buttons, plese add DecisionMakerPanel plugin from `Panels -> Add New Panel` on rviz.  
<img src="docs/decision_maker_panel.png" width=800>

### Start Driving with simulation
1. Open run time manager and rviz
2. In Map tab, load Vector Map and TF files you use(Point Cloud is optional).  
3. In Computing tab, launch `Decision -> decision_maker(experimental)` and check the state.  
The state at that time:
> Init  
> SensorInit  
> WaitVehicleReady  
> Stopping  
> WaitDriveReady  
4. In Computing tab, click [app] next to `Motion Planning -> waypoint_follower -> wf_simulator` and set the value of accele_rate to `5`, and launch `Motion Planning -> waypoint_follower -> wf_simulator`.  
Then the state changes:
> Init  
> **LocalizationInit**  
> WaitVehicleReady  
> Stopping  
> WaitDriveReady  
5. In Computing tab, launch `Localization -> autoware_connector -> vel_pose_connect` with Simulation Mode option in [ app ], and publish `/initialpose` topic using `2D Pose Estimate` tool in rviz.  
Then the state changes:  
> **VehicleReady**  
> **WaitOrder**  
> Stopping  
> WaitDriveReady
6. In Computing tab, click [app] next to `Motion Planning -> waypoint_follower -> pure_pursuit` and change setting from `Dialog` to `Waypoint`.  
And launch nodes below.  
`Mission Planning -> lane_planner -> lane_rule`  
`Mission Planning -> lane_planner -> lane_stop`  
`Mission Planning -> lane_planner -> lane_select`  
`Motion Planning -> waypoint_planner -> astar_avoid`  
`Motion Planning -> waypoint_planner -> velocity_set`  
`Motion Planning -> waypoint_follower -> pure_pursuit`  
`Motion Planning -> waypoint_follower -> twist_filter`
7. In Computing tab, launch `Motion Planning -> waypoint_maker -> waypoint_loader` with waypoint file(s) you want to use.  
Then the state changes:  
> VehicleReady  
> **DriveReady**  
> Stopping  
> **WaitEngage**  

 If the state is `MissionCheck` instead of `DriveReady`, please set the position near the waypoint by `2D Pose Estimate` tool.
8. Push `Engage` button in `DecisionMakerPanel`.  
The vehicle start to drive, and the state changes as follows for example:
> VehicleReady  
> **Driving**  
> **Moving**  
> **LaneArea**  
> **Cruise**  
> **Straight**  
> **Drive**  
> **Go**

### Stop line function
There are two ways to enable stop line function as follows.

##### Use waypoint flag
1. Open waypoint file and modify stop_flag column of index that you want to stop.  
Details of stop_flag's value:
```
0: None
1: Stopline(automatically resume driving after stop)
2: Stop(stop only, wait for command)
```
Example image:  
<img src="docs/stop_flag.png" width=800>

2. Start driving with the modified waypoint file.


##### Use vector map
The stopline, roadsign and the vector map files that accompany them are required.
1. Open stopline file and change the value of SignID column that you want to stop to the roadsign's ID to be linked.
2. Open the roadsign file and change the value in the Type column for the ID linked in the previous step. Details of the Type are same as stop_flag.  
Example image:  
<img src="docs/stopline_vectormap.png" width=800>

3. Start driving with the modified vector map.

##### Publish topic
You need to know in advance the index of the waypoint you want to stop.
The index is `gid` of waypoint.
1. Publish `state/stop_order_wpidx` topic with the index you want to stop.
2. After the vehicle has stopped, publish `/state_cmd` topic with `clear` key and then the vehicle will resume driving.

### Lane change
  1. Start driving with waypoint files necessary for lane change
  2. On `CheckLeft` or `RightLane` state, push `Execute LaneChange` button on DecisionMakerPannel
  3. The vehicle start lane change

### Driving mission change
  1. Prepare waypoint files to change, and start Normal driving
  2. On `Driving` state, push `Request mission change` button on DecisionMakerPannel
  3. When the state becomes `DrivingMissionChange`, please load another waypoint for change
  4. If it is possible to change the waypoint will switch, otherwise it will not be changed
